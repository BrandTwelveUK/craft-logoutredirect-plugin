# Logout Redirect plugin for Craft CMS

Redirect users when they logout on the frontend.

## Installation

To install Logout Redirect, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `logoutredirect` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `logoutredirect` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Logout Redirect works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

Please note: This is our first very tiny plugin so any issues, just let us know. We've got plans to make this more advanced more as an exercise.
